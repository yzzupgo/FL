### Manual：

Two distinct entry files are provided for the two datasets. For SIR， you can use `SIR.py`. For CodeFlaws, you can use `codeflaws.py`. In the form of files, you can find the programs we've written for the various methods.
You can make relevant changes to adapt your experiments.

The MBFL-related programs can be found under the `mbfl`. We wrote the appropriate code for the various technologies and formulas.

The SBFL-related programs can be found under the `sbfl`. You can even include more formulas.

The `data_codeflaws.py` and `util.py` files contain the code for the fundamental information.

#### Remarks：

* This tool passed experiment on the "Ubuntu Linux Intel i5 Xeon e7-480".
* python version : 3.6.8
* 
Baseline contains the baseline script file,

and HOMS contains scripts for high-order mutations generated by three methods.

Calculate suspicion clacSusNew.py

Calculate gradient ranking clacRank.py

Calculate true ranking: clacAlITypeRank.py

Calculate topn: clacCorrectTopn.py

Integrate topn of all projects: clacAllTop-n.py

Execute the above files in sequence to obtain the results
