### Manual：

Two distinct entry files are provided for the two datasets. For SIR， you can use `SIR.py`. For CodeFlaws, you can use `codeflaws.py`. In the form of files, you can find the programs we've written for the various methods.
You can make relevant changes to adapt your experiments.

The MBFL-related programs can be found under the `mbfl`. We wrote the appropriate code for the various technologies and formulas.

The SBFL-related programs can be found under the `sbfl`. You can even include more formulas.

The `data_codeflaws.py` and `util.py` files contain the code for the fundamental information.

#### Remarks：

* This tool passed experiment on the "Ubuntu Linux Intel i5 Xeon e7-480".
* python version : 3.6.8
* 
Baseline contains the baseline script file,

and HOMS contains scripts for high-order mutations generated by three methods.

Calculate suspicion clacSusNew.py

Calculate gradient ranking clacRank.py

Calculate true ranking: clacAlITypeRank.py

Calculate topn: clacCorrectTopn.py

Integrate topn of all projects: clacAllTop-n.py

Execute the above files in sequence to obtain the results

The results of TOP-N, MAP, and EXAM of our method are included respectively. 
TOP-N needs to be combined with scripts to generate the final results. 
We provide detailed operation instructions in the README file of the code. 
It also includes the data of the charts involved in the article.
