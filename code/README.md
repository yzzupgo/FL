### Manual：

Two distinct entry files are provided for the two datasets. For SIR， you can use `SIR.py`. For CodeFlaws, you can use `codeflaws.py`. In the form of files, you can find the programs we've written for the various methods.
You can make relevant changes to adapt your experiments.

The MBFL-related programs can be found under the `mbfl`. We wrote the appropriate code for the various technologies and formulas.

The SBFL-related programs can be found under the `sbfl`. You can even include more formulas.

The `data_codeflaws.py` and `util.py` files contain the code for the fundamental information.
