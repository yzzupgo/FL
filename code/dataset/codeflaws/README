##Codeflaws dataset

Codeflaws is a publicly available defect dataset specifically designed for the study of faults in competitive programming. It contains hundreds of C programs collected from various online programming platforms, featuring representative logical and implementation errors. Codeflaws offers an ideal environment for researching and developing automated detection and repair tools targeted at programming errors.

This dataset includes not only the faulty versions of programs but also their corrected versions, enabling researchers to perform precise evaluations and testing of automated tools. The design of Codeflaws supports a broad range of software engineering research, including fault localization, automatic program repair, program understanding, and test case generation.
