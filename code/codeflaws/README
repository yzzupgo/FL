## CODEFLOWs Dataset

[CODEFLOWs](https://github.com/your-username/codeflows-repository) is a comprehensive dataset focused on capturing and analyzing code execution flows and method call relationships. Designed to support research in control flow and data flow analysis, this dataset is crucial for software testing, code optimization, and security analysis. By providing detailed method call sequences and execution paths, CODEFLOWs enables researchers and developers to deeply understand the dynamic behaviors of code and develop more efficient program analysis and debugging tools.

The dataset features rich execution trace information that aids in identifying and analyzing complex behavior patterns in software, including potential performance bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities. It is suitable for developing advanced program analysis techniques such as dynamic slicing, mutation testing, and model-based testing.
